highly recommend to use. 

In this notebook we study or analyse the similarity of some beaches in Costa Rica and their arounds in order to reveal where is a good zone to open another (business) resturant. 
The idea is if X beache(s) are very similar a restaurant we could create a restuarant there, of course we have to do more research but this is a start.
