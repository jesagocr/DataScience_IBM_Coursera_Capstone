highly recommend to use. 

In this notebook we study or analyse the similarity of some beaches in Costa Rica and their arounds in order to reveal where is a good zone to open another (business) resturant. 
The idea is if X beache(s) is(are) similar to my current restaurant we could open another one there, or we can find other insights, who knows. Of course we have to do more research but this is a start. 
We use the Foursquare API to explore the zone around the beach and understand how develop this is.
